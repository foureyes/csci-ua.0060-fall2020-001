## Constraints Revisited

__We briefly talked about constraints for SQLite... and similar constraints exist for MySQL. What are some constraints we can add to column(s)?__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} `UNIQUE`
* {:.fragment} `NOT NULL`
* {:.fragment} `PRIMARY KEY` - implies both `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`
	* {:.fragment} note that MySQL/MariaDB enforces the not null part for a pk, unlike SQLite
* {:.fragment} `CHECK`
* {:.fragment} `FOREIGN KEY`

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Specifying Constraints

__As you've seen, these constraints can be added at the column level__ &rarr;

```
colname1 NOT NULL,
colname2 CHECK (colname2 > 10)
```
{:.fragment}

However, constraints can also be specified at the table level...
{:.fragment}


</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Table Level Constraints

__Rather than defining constraints on each column, `PRIMARY KEY`, `CHECK` and `FOREIGN KEY` can be specified at the table level__ &rarr;


```
CREATE TABLE t (
	a INT, 
	b INT, 
	c INT, 
	PRIMARY KEY (a, b)
);
```
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Foreign Key Constraints

__Foreign keys can be defined as table level constraints__ &rarr;

```
FOREIGN KEY (col_name) REFERENCE other_table(other_col_name)
```

```
CREATE TABLE t1(
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
);
```
{:.fragment}

```
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (null), (null);
```
{:.fragment}

```
CREATE TABLE t2(
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	t1_id INTEGER,
	FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id)
);
```
{:.fragment}

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Foreign Keys Explained

__Foreign keys__ ensure integrity between related tables. For example, it could guarantee that a column in the first table that references a column in the second table actually has matching value in the second table.

* {:.fragment} if I try to insert a row with a foreign key value...
* {:.fragment} ... and that value doesn't exist in the related table
* {:.fragment} then the insert won't work!
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Check Constraints and MySQL / MariaDB

‚ö†Ô∏è __Constraint syntax is fully supported after MariaDB 10.2.1 and MySQL 8.0.16__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} prior to those version constraints are valid syntax, but the actual constraint is ignored! üòÆ
* {:.fragment} as of fall 2020, the MariaDB version on our database server is 5.5.x üò¢
* {:.fragment} __so we can add constraints, but they'll be silently ignored__

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Constraints Exercise

__If you were tasked with storing course data in a database, what table name, fields, types, and constraints would you use?__ &rarr;

One potential solution might be:
{:.fragment}

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
create table course (
  course_number varchar(100),
  section_number varchar(10),
  semester varchar(20),
  year smallint,
  title text,
  description text,
  constraint year_after_found check (year > 1831),
  primary key (course_number, section_number, semester, year)
);
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

* note the composite primary key as a table level constraint
* the generic constraint on year 
{:.fragment}

## Let's Add Some Rows!

__Based on the previous table definition, which of these queries _should_ fail with an error, and which ones will work__ (they'll fail in sqlite3, but  will unforuntately be allowed for older versions of MariaDB/MySQL)? &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
insert into course values

insert into course 
  (course_number, semester, year, title) 
values 
  ('0060', 'fall', 2020, 'db');
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## A Quick Aside on Union

Before we get into combining columns from different tables, __there is a way to put together the results from two queries.__ &rarr;

You can use `UNION` to "stack" the results of two queries!
{:.fragment}

```
insert into course values 
  ('0480', '034', 'spring', 2020, 'ait', 'web stuff'),
  ('00101', '001', 'summer', 2020, 'intro to cs', 'coffee!');
```
{:.fragment}

We can sort of emulate group by putting together two queries that count:
{:.fragment}

```
select semester, count(*) from course where semester = 'fall' 
union 
select semester, count(*) from course where semester = 'spring';
```

## Self Join Attempt #2

Well. __That didn't work__ üòû... since we're matching on year, we're getting movies that match themselves on both tables!

__What could we do to fix this?__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} let's try filtering the rows with a `WHERE` clause

## Self Join Attempt #3 

The previous attempt got rid rows with the same title in both `a` and `b`, but now we have twice as many rows since the duplicate rows have the titles switching columns. __What now?__ ü§î&rarr;

## How Are They Related?

__In our `movie` and `genre` example, how are movie and genre related in terms of cardinality?__ 

Based on where the foreign key is (it's placed on `movie`!)...

* {:.fragment} can a movie have multiple genres (can Hellboy be both horror and fantasy)?
* {:.fragment} can a genre have multiple movies (can the sci-fi genre encompass Alphaville, Bladerunner, etc.)
* {:.fragment} ...or maybe both: can movie have multiple genres and a genre have multiple movies?

In this relationship, multiple movies can have the same genre id: for every one genre, there could be many movies (but a movie can't have more than one genre).
{:.fragment}

This is called a __one-to-many__ relationship!
{:.fragment}

</section>
<section markdown="block">
## Table Relationships

The possible cardinalities of rows in related tables are:

1. {:.fragment} one-to-many
2. {:.fragment} many-to-many
3. {:.fragment} one-to-one

(for all these cases, 0 is a possibility on the right hand side; it's trickier to ensure that there's exactly or at least one, though)
{:.fragment}

__Anyway, let's figure out where the foreign keys go to implement all of these relationships...__ &rarr;
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## One to Many

If you have a __foreign key__ in your table .... it will be the many side in a __one-to-many__ relationship. &rarr;


* {:.header .colspan} movie
* {:.header} movie_id (pk), title, genre_id (fk)
* 1, Dune, 57
* 2, A Quiet Place, 57
* 3, 2046, 58
{:.fragment}
{:.table}

* {:.header .colspan} genre
* {:.header} genre_id (pk), name
* 57, Sci-Fi
* 58, Drama
{:.fragment}
{:.table}

* {:.fragment} rows in `movie` can reference the same `genre_id` 
* {:.fragment} (both Dune and a Quiet Place have 57 listed as the related genre id) 
* {:.fragment} ... meaning __one__ `genre` can have __many__ `movie`s

</section>


<section markdown="block">
## One to One

__Let's see one potential implementation__ &rarr;


* {:.header .colspan} user
* {:.header} user_id (pk), username, profile_id (fk __unique__)
* 1, alice, 34
* 2, bob, 35
{:.fragment}
{:.table}

* {:.header .colspan} profile
* {:.header} profile_id (pk), avatar_url
* 34, foo.bar/baz.png
* 35, ne.at.io/hi.gif
{:.fragment}
{:.table}

Uh... isn't this the same as one-to-many? 
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} if we put a __unique__ constraint on the foreign key, that means a value for profile id can only occur once in `movie` 
* {:.fragment} this means there can be either no associated profile or only associated profile for a __one-to-one__ relationship.
* {:.fragment} if you want exactly one-to-one, just put it in the same table! (some databases allow you to make circular foreign keys with [deferred constraints in a transaction](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-set-constraints.html) to achieve this)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Many to Many

__What if we wanted movies to have many genres, and genres to have many movies?__

* Dune is both Sci-Fi and Drama,
* Sci-Fi is a genre that both Dune and A Quiet Place have
{:.fragment}


Maybe `movie` could contain `genre_id` and  `genre` can contain `movie_id`
{:.fragment}


* {:.header .colspan} movie
* {:.header} movie_id (pk), title, genre_id
* 1, Dune, 57
* 1, Dune, 58
* 2, A Quiet Place, 57
{:.fragment}
{:.table}

* {:.header .colspan} genre
* {:.header} genre_id (pk), name, movie_id
* 57, Sci-Fi, 1
* 57, Sci-Fi, 2
* 58, Drama, 1
{:.fragment}
{:.table}


üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è... this __may note be the best solution__! why not?
{:.fragment}

duplicate / redundant data in both tables!
{:.fragment}
</section>


<section markdown="block">
## Many to Many II 


__For many-to-many, create a third table that houses ids of both other tables__ (so only ids are duplicated) &rarr;


* {:.header .colspan} movie
* {:.header} movie_id (pk), title
* 1, Dune
* 2, A Quiet Place
* 3, 2046
{:.fragment}
{:.table}

* {:.header .colspan} movie_genre
* {:.header} movie_id (fk), genre_id (fk)

{:.fragment}
{:.table}

* {:.header .colspan} genre
* {:.header} genre_id (pk), name
* 57, Sci-Fi
* 58, Drama
{:.fragment}
{:.table}

* {:.fragment} now, Dune has 2 genres and Drama has 2 movies
* {:.fragment} why not just set an fk in each table? that would lead to duplicate rows in either table!
* {:.fragment} sometimes this is called a __join table__; other names include __association__ and __junction__ table
* {:.fragment} this __join table__ can have additional columns, but minimally, the pk of both other tables
