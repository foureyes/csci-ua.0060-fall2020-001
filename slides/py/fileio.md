##  Where's My Stuff?

When our programs are run, we usually have a bunch of variables that store numbers, lists, strings and all sorts of other data.  __But where do you think this data is actually stored?__ &rarr;


<div class="fragment" markdown="block">
Our program and the data that our programs have been using is stored in your computer's main memory (really!  I mean, where _else_ would you put values that need to be _remembered_)
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  RAM!?

Your computer's __main memory__ or __RAM__ (random access memory) is an example of __volatile memory__.

* __volatile memory__ - memory that requires an electrical current to maintain state
* __non-volatile memory__ - memory that can maintain state without power

__What are some examples of non-volatile memory__ &rarr;

<div class="fragment" markdown="block">
Hard drives, flash drives, CDs and DVDs
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  Storing Data in Main Memory

__What are the consequences of your data being stored in your computer's main memory?__ &rarr;

<div class="fragment" markdown="block">
* data may go away at the end of the program, or when the computer gets turned off
* if you're working with large amounts of data, you may run out of RAM (which is typically less than the amount of non-volatile memory that you have)!
</div>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  I Want Data to Last Longer Than That

__What if we want to persist our data beyond the lifetime of the running program... or through on-off cycles?__ &rarr;

<div class="fragment" markdown="block">
* let's store data on non-volatile media!
* ... maybe as a file on your hard drive or SSD...

<section markdown="block">
##  File Input and Output

* we can store data in files!
* Python can handle file input and output - __file I/O__
</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  open

Python has a __built-in__ function called __open__.  

* __open__ opens a file!
* it can be used for __reading__ or __writing__
* it takes two arguments: a __filename__ and a __mode__
	* __filename__
		* the absolute path... 
		* or relative (to the script that your writing) path
	* __mode__ ... for now, we only care about:
		* __'w'__ - write
		* __'r'__ - read
		* __'a'__ - append
* it returns a __file object__
</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  A File Object ...

* is an object that allows your program to manipulate/read/write to an actual file on disk
* to create a file object and open a file, use the built-in function, __open__()

</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  Writing to a File

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
f = open("test.txt", "w")
f.write("I'm in yr filez!\n")
f.write("Writin' some bits!\n")
f.write("...\n")
f.close()
</code></pre>

* call __open__ ...
	* with the name of the file to open, 'test.txt'
	* and the mode, 'w' to specify that we're writing to it
* use the __write__() method to write strings to a file
* you must always call __close__() on  file when you're done with it
</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  Using open to Write to a File

Let's look at __open__ and __write__ in more detail:

__open(filename, mode)__

* filename is the file to be opened
* a mode of 'w' means that the file will be opened for writing
* if the file doesn't exist, 'w' will __create__ it
* if the file exists, 'w' will __overwrite__ it!

__write(s)__

* does not automatically add new lines
* takes a string as an argument (non-string arguments result in an error)
</section>



<section markdown="block">
## Remember to Close It!!!

Once you're done working with your file, __remember to close it by__:

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
file_obj.close()
</code></pre>

‚ö†Ô∏è __If you don't do this, the file may not be written to!__



</section>

<section markdown="block">
## A More Pythonic Way

__It's easy to forget to close a file, so you'll often see another method of dealing with files__ &rarr;

Use the keyword, `with` to create a block of code that automatically cleans up after itself (that is, it will close at the end of a block!)

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
with open('some_file.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
	    print(line)

# automatically closes üëç

##  Lottery Ticket

Write a program that creates a lottery ticket.  The lottery ticket should:

* have the words "Lucky Numbers" on the first line
* contain 5 __unique__ numbers between 1 through 59
* each number printed from __lowest to highest__
* each number printed on its own line
* be saved to a file named lotto.txt

##  BTDubz (re random)

By the way... (of course) there's already a function in the random module that does this: 

* random.__sample__(population, k)
	* __population__ - a sequence or set (think list) containing the elements to sample from
	* __k__ - the number of elements to retrieve
* example output:

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
>>> print(random.sample([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 4))
[7, 3, 1, 6]

##  Reading a File

To open a file in read mode, use "r" as the second argument:

f = open("test.txt", "r")
</code></pre>

</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  Reading a File

Once you have a __file object__ (sometimes called a file handle), you can read the contents of a file by: using one of the following methods on your __file handle object__:

* __iterating__ over the __file object__ itself (use a for loop with the file object)
* using one of the following __methods__ on the __file object__
	* __readline__() - read one line at a time
	* __readlines__() - reads entire contents of a file into memory as a list (each element is a line)
	* __read__() - reads the entire contents of a file into memory as a string

{% comment %}
__Why would you use one method over another?__

<div class="fragment" markdown="block">
* you may want to use read if you're operating on the contents of the file as a whole
* you may want to use readline if you're working with a very large file
</div>
{% endcomment %}

<section markdown="block">
##  The Easiest Way to Read a File

Once you have a file object, you can actually _iterate_ over the file object itself. That is, you can use a __for loop__ to loop over every line in the __file object__:

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
f = open("test.txt", "r")
for line in f:
    print(line)
</code></pre>

üëÄ __When reading a file, the most simple and efficient way to do it is simply looping over the file object itself__

<section markdown="block">
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Reading a File

__There are a few things to watch out for when reading a file__ &rarr;

1. {:.fragment} if passing only a file name to open, then python will look in the directory that the script is in
	* {:.fragment} if using an IDE like PyCharm, that means the file to be read __must be in the project directory__ 
	* {:.fragment} of course, you can also use an __absolute path__: `/path/to/file.txt` or `c:\\path\\to\\file.txt`
2. {:.fragment} if a __file isn't found__ when reading, an __exception is raised__
3. {:.fragment} once __you've read through a file__, __you can't read it again__ üôÖ (unless you re-open or use _other_ file io methods outside the scope of this class)
4. {:.fragment} _that newline_ ... note that newlines are read from files along with the actual line!


Let's take a look at the last 3 more closely.
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## File Not Found!

__What if we try to open a file that doesn't exist for reading?__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
with open('does-not-exist.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
</code></pre>

An exception: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'does-not-exist.txt'`
{:.fragment}

</section>


<section markdown="block">
## Looping Over File Object Twice


__What does the following code print out assuming that `foo.txt` contains two lines: `bar` and `baz`?__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
with open('foo.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(1)
    for line in f:
        print(line)

    print(2)
    for line_again in f:
        print(line)
</code></pre>

`1`, `bar`, `baz` and `2`... but nothing after that! üò≤
{:.fragment}


‚ö†Ô∏è  again, __once a file is read through, you can't read through it again__.
{:.fragment}

<section markdown="block">
## Explain this Mystery 

__`foo.txt` contains two lines: `bar` and `baz`... explain the output of this code...__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
with open('foo.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
bar 

baz 
&nbsp;
</code></pre>

Notice the newlines. __But y tho?__

Each line has a newline at the end, `print` adds a newline.
{:.fragment}

<section markdown="block">
##  Using readline

__readline__() takes no arguments, and it returns a string.

* it always returns a string, even if it's just a new line character ("\n")
* if it returns an empty string, then we've reached the end of the file
</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  Using readline Continued

__To use readline to read the contents of a file, loop forever (or at least until we know that we're at the end of a file! ...__

<div class="fragment" markdown="block">
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
f = open("test.txt", "r")
while True:
	line = f.readline()

<section markdown="block">
##  Using readline() Continued More!

Using the test.txt file we've used in previous examples:


<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
I'm in yr filez!

__What is the first line that will be printed?  What is the actual string representation? How many times will the loop run?__

##  Reading a File in All At Once

Use the __read__() method on your file handle object to read the file in all at once.  __read__() returns the entire contents of a file (including newlines) as a string.

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
f = open("test.txt", "r")
contents = f.read()
print(contents)
</code></pre>

</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  Reading a File in All At Once

Use the __readlines__() method on your file handle object to read the file in all at once as a list, with each line being a single element in the list. 

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
f = open("test.txt", "r")
lines = f.readlines()
for line in lines:
	print(line)

<section markdown="block">
##  Memory Efficiency

__Which function uses more main memory, readline or read/readlines? Why?__ &rarr;

<div class='fragment' markdown='block'>
* read/readlines consumes more memory because it reads the entire file at once!
* similarly, in our previous exercises... we had solutions that either used up a lot of memory... or were expensive computationally

##  Creating Text Files

Both PyCharm and IDLE can be used to work on files that _aren't_ Python programs. __To save a _plain text_ file__ &rarr;


* go to __new file__ as usual
* ...and __save as__ ... but add __.txt__ as your extension

(You can also open file that aren't .py or .txt, as long as they're just _plain text_)
