* {:.fragment} a package management tool such as [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
	* this should be installed with Python on most platforms
	* (if you're on Linux, you may have to install it separately)
	* we'll be installing packages like `pymongo`, `pandas`, etc.
* {:.fragment} some parts of this class will use __jupyter notebook/lab__
	* `pip3 install jupyterlab`

## Submitting Homework Assignments

__We'll be using a source code management tool called git to keep track of, submit, and backup assignments__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} GitHub will be used to house repositories that you will push your completed assignments to
* {:.fragment} you can use commandline or graphical git clients... 
* {:.fragment} some popular graphical clients include
