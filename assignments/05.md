# Assignment #5 - MySQL, JOINS and Subqueries

# ⚠️ Due Tuesday, 10/10 at Noon __BEFORE CLASS__!


In this homework, you'll:

1. practice joins
2. practice subqueries

You'll do this by working with two datasets:

1. The FDA's collection of adverse event reports
2. A subset of the sample data from [www.mariadbtutorial.com](https://www.mariadbtutorial.com/getting-started/mariadb-sample-database/)

## Part 1 - CAERS Dataset

1. Finish `lab03_queries.sql` from [workshop 3](lab03.html)
	* you have already turned in the form for the lab
	* so you only have to work on finishing up the queries
2. You can continue working on this with your group or work on your own
3. Once you're done, add `lab03_queries.sql` to the root of your homework 05 repository (add, commit, and push as you have with other homework assignments)


## Part 2 - Nations Sample Dataset

### Overview

The site [www.mariadbtutorial.com](www.mariadbtutorial.com) has a sample database containing information about countries (such as population, languages, etc.). This data is spread across multiple tables.

This is a practice data set:

* the site does not provide any details on the provenance of the data nor does it have a license
* do not use this data for research purposes
* we are using it to practice joins and subqueries
	* it's small enough to easily understand, but big enough that simply _looking_ at the data wouldn't be a replacement for writing proper sql queries
	* the subject matter is straightforward (countries, continents, etc.), allowing you to focus on the mechanics of writing SQL

Note that it's worth [taking a look at the site](https://www.mariadbtutorial.com/) as another study resources. It supplements the online documentation nicely in that it fills in the gaps left by MariaDBs docs by providing very accessible examples.

### Instructions

#### Uploading .sql file to i6

Use `scp` on MacOS... or on Windows, [winscp](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php), to upload a file to i6.

1. Download [nation_subset.sql](05/nation_subset.sql), a file containing sql statements to create several tables and populate both tables with country data
	* __OR__ use the `nation_subset.sql` file in your repository
2. Upload the file to i6
	* in MacOS, open a terminal and `cd` into the directory that you downloaded `nation_subset.sql` to
	* for example, if you downloaded to your Downloads folder, `cd ~/Downloads`
	* in terminal, type `scp nation_subset.sql YOUR_USERNAME@i6.cims.nyu.edu:~`
		* `YOUR_USERNAME` should be your cims/i6 username (typically netid)
		* enter your cims/i6 password when prompted
		* the `~` part means upload the file to the home directory
	* in Windows, use WinSCP to upload the file to your home directory
		* you're presented with a graphical user interface
		* use `i6.cims.nyu.edu` as the hostname
		* 
		* once connected, you can drag and drop or use the buttons to transfer files from your computer (local) to i6 (the server)

#### Importing Data

1.  Login to i6, using ssh (MacOS, Linux) or WinSCP (Windows 10). See the [documentation for details](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/connect) on connecting. TL;DR version:
	* On MacOS/Linux
		* open a terminal (MacOS &rarr; search Terminal.app)
		* type in: `ssh YOUR_USERNAME@i6.cims.nyu.edu`, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual cims/i6 username (typically netid)
		* you will be prompted for a password
		* type your cims/i6 password (it will not be displayed as you type it)
		* go to step 3
	* On Windows 10
		* if you don't already have it installed, [download putty - using the installer (.msi) is ok](https://www.putty.org/) (note - putty is not required if you already have an ssh client that you use)
		* run the application...
		* in the host name field, type in: `i6.cims.nyu.edu`
		* click on `Open`
		* you may be prompted to accept a host key; click `Yes`
		* enter your cims/i6 username (typically netid)... and then your cims/i6 password
2. Once on i6, you should see `nation_subset.sql` in your home directory by typing in `ls`
3. Run the sql in `nation_subset.sql` by using the mysql client
	* Type this command in terminal when logged in to i6... 
	* `mysql -h warehouse.cims.nyu.edu -u YOUR_USERNAME -p YOUR_DATABASE_NAME < nation_subset.sql`
	* You can replace YOUR_DATABASE_NAME with the same database you used for homework 4 (`test` prefixed with your username and underscore)
	* Alternatively, if you'd like to keep things a little more organized, you can make a `yourusername_hw05` database by [logging in to the database manager](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/login/cims?origin=%2Fwebapps%2Fdatabases) and creating a new database there

	
#### Running Queries

1. __While on i6, connect to MariaDB__: `mysql -h warehouse.cims.nyu.edu -u YOUR_USERNAME -p YOUR_DATABASE_NAME` 
2. In a text editor on your __local__ computer, open `hw05_queries.sql` from the root of your cloned repository...
3. You should find questions in SQL comments
4. Write out queries and test them on MariaDB against the data you imported
5. Please remember to use your GitHub client to add, commit, and push your work as you go along
