# Assignment #3 - Single Table, Importing Data, SQL - Due Tuesday, 10/6  at 11pm

In this homework, you'll:

1. convert data from the previous homework into a csv file, if it isn't already a csv file
2. design a table based on your data (`create_table.sql`)
3. import your csv into your database 
4. run a few simple queries (`queries.sql`)
5. __write about the results of your queries (`report.md`)__


## Reuse or generate a csv File

1. copy over your data set from the previous homework
	* if your data did not come in a csv or if you'd like to do some preprocessing before you import it into a database, use plain python to do so
	* save any script or notebook that you used to do this within your repository as `src/clean.py`
	* save the result (the new csv) of running your script or notebook in your repository - choose a descriptive name for the resulting `.csv (`students.csv`, `dog_bites.csv`) and place this it in `data/processed`
	* the csv should be contain your original data set or a cleaned/transformed data set
	* if the resulting csv is over 100mb, use a subset of the data
2. __in your `report.md`, under a heading called `# Overview`, once again, copy over your documentation citing the source of the data and what it contains based on the previous homeworks (columns, expected types, etc.)__

__If you'd like to use a new data set, please contact me... and add similar documentation of your new data set to `report.md`.__

## Design and Create a Table

1. based on the your csv, design a table to import your data into (see the slides on data types and creating a table)
	* determine what field should be a primary key (unique, something that will not be changed)
	* if no field is a good candidate for a primary key, you can use an automatically incrementing integer as the surrogate / artificial primary key
	* think of the appropriate data type for all of the other fields
	* consider whether or not you'd like to allow null values, duplicates, or set default values
2. __in `report.md`, under a heading called `# Table Design`,  write up your decisions for each field__ (for example, you can say that you have allowed null values for a particular field because there is missing data in your csv, or if there's missing data ... you'll fill with a default value)
3. write the _actual_ SQL to make this table, and put it into your `create_table.sql`
	* make sure that the appropriate constraints are set (`NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, etc.)
	* use descriptive names for the table and columns
	* make sure all names are lowercase and separated with underscore
4. run the SQL in your `create_table.sql` file within your sqlite commandline tool 
5. save the resulting database into `homework03.db`

## Import Your .csv

Now for the moment of truth! Try importing your csv. If there are errors, __note the errors in your `report.md` and how you fixed them under a heading called `# Import`__

* remember to use `.mode csv` prior to importing
* since you've created a table first, remove the header from your csv
* if there are no errors, just note that the import succeeded without error
* you can continue to refine your create table sql file and your csv
* but you can only do this (^^^^)  as long as you __add notes about your refinements under `# Import`__
* ...and as long as all the other related files are updated 
* (for example `create_table.sql` should contain the new `CREATE` statement if you had to change the way your table was made... or if you needed to clean up the csv a little more, you'd have to drop in the new csv)
* if you're a little more comfortable with git, it would be best to commit after each modification


## Run Some Simple Queries

Run commands and queries on your newly imported data. Please run all of your queries in the SQLite commandline tool.

### First, run some commands to see what's in your table

1. show all of the tables in your database (there should only be 1!)
2. show information about the table's columns (names and types)

__Once you've run the commands for the above, copy and paste BOTH the commands and the results into your `report.md` file under a header called `# Database Information`.__

### Now, run some queries to determine / calculate / show some information

As you go through writing your queries, you'll be adding information to two files `queries.sql` and `report.md`:

* __add your query to `queries.sql` with a comment above each statement reflecting the number and information you are extracting__
	<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>-- 2. number and description from below	
YOUR QUERY UNDERNEATH;
</code></pre>
* __add the results of each query to your `report.md`__
	* __this should go under a heading called `# Query Results`__
	* remember to add the number and description of the results based on the specifications below
	* drop this into a markdown "code" block (surround with triple backticks)
		<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>```
### 2. number and description from instructions below, such as "show the first 15 rows...."
Your | Results | Here
-----+---------+-----
foo  | bar     | baz
```
</code></pre>

Write queries to do / show the following:

1. do some rudimentary data cleaning by modifying values in a column or columns (such as change '' to NULL, cast types, etc.) ... instead of adding the results of the query or queries to `report.md`, write the motivation for modifying / cleaning your data in this way
2. the total number of rows in the database
3. show the first 15 rows, but only display 3 columns (your choice)
4. do the same as above, but choose a column to sort on, and sort in descending order
5. add a new column without a default value
6. set the value of that new column
7. show only the unique (non duplicates) of a column of your choice
8. group rows together by a column value (your choice) and use an aggregate function to calculate _something_ about that group (count of all members of the group, the average of a column of the members of the group)
	* show the column that is used for grouping AND the result of the aggregate function (so, 2 columns minimum on output)
9. now, using the same grouping query or creating another one, find a way to filter the query results based on the values for the groups (for example, show all genres that have more than 2 movies in it and only show the genre and the number of movies for that genre).
	* you'll use a `HAVING` clause to do this (covered in the slides on group by)


Add another __3 queries__ of your own that helps you gain some insight on your data (ok to reproduce the work that you did previously for the previous homework... but using sql instead of python). You must include one of each of the following in any of your queries (that is, one of #1 and one of #2 below in any part of your work for queries 10-12):

1. a built-in scalar function from [https://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html](https://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html) or a data time function from [https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html)
2. a built-in aggregation function from [https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html)

__Document each query (10 - 12) in your `report.md` and `queries.sql` file__

âš ðŸ‘€ Lastly, __make a copy of your database (`homework03.db`) file and place it into `data/processed`__


### Conclusion

At the end of the homework, you should have these files:

1. `/data/raw/name_your_file.csv`
2. `/src/create_table.sql`
3. `/src/queries.sql`
4. `/report.md` (note that report should contain the following headers)
	* Overview
	* Table Design
	* Import
	* Database Information
	* Query Results
5. `/data/processed/homework03.db`

If you processed your data with Python beforehand, you may have additional files:

1. `src/clean.py` 
2. `data/processed/*` where * is your processed data
