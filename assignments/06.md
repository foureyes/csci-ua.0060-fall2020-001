# Homework #6 - Database Design - Due <strike>Thursday, Nov 5th at 11pm</strike> Tuesday, Nov 10th at 11pm

In this workshop, you'll:

1. Use "business" requirements to build a database 
	1. Create a conceptual data model
	2. Create a physical model
	3. Write CREATE table statements or use forward engineering 
	4. Write queries against the tables created
2. Normalize the data from previous assignments 
	1. Normalize the data from previous assignments (or find a new data source)
	2. Create an ER diagram for the physical model representing the normalized data
	3. Write a few queries that may work with this new data model

## Part 1: Use "business" requirements to design and create tables in a database

To save some money üí∞, instead of taking an Public Transit/Uber/Lyft/Taxi all over the city, you and a bunch of friends decide to buy a pool of electric scooters to share!

Other students find out about your scooter scheme, and want to join in üôå! You rent out a small storefront to be the base of your _Scoot Share_ ... where people can go to to borrow or return a scooter (for a small hourly fee), 24 hours / day üåûüåî! Now you have to keep track of an ever-growing fleet of electric scooters __and__ who's borrowed them. 

### Here's how your _Scoot Share_ works:

1. A person comes into your store to borrow a scooter...
2. You take down their name and contact information
	* for contact information, you simply need a way to get in touch with them in case you need to track down an unreturned scooter or a damaged scooter, so the following are required:
		* email address
		* cell phone 
		* home address
	* keep track of when they initially gave you their information
3. If they've borrowed a scooter before, you can just retrieve all of their previous information from the first time they borrowed a scooter
4. If they already have a scooter borrowed, but that they haven't returned it, then they can't borrow another scooter
5. If they've been referred by someone else that had previously borrowed a scooter, make sure to take note of that 
	* it's adequate to simply know who referred who; no additional information has to be kept about a referral
	* of course, someone can come it without having been referred
6. They can borrow a scooter for a set number of hours
	* it's important to note when they actually borrow a scooter
	* and, of course, when they need to return it
6. Then... they choose a scooter to borrow from your inventory of available scooters
	* the scooters vary, with differences in:
		* manufacturer
		* the manufacturer's country
		* model number
		* range (in kilometers)
		* weight (in kilograms) 
		* top speed (in kilometers/hour)
		* condition (new, slightly used, used)
	* you can have multiple scooters that have the same manufacturer and model number
8. When they return the scooter...
	* keep track of when it was returned
	* and determine if the return is late or not, and check for damage
	* ... keep track of damage so that the next person borrowing the scooter isn't held responsible for previous damage!
9. An arbitrary number of _freeform_ notes can be added to when a person borrows a scooter
	* these notes can be used to indicate issues that come up while the scooter is being used or when it's returned (for example, the scooter may not meet its stated max range while it's out... or the scooter may be returned with handle grips missing)
	* in addition to the text, notes can be categorized as: return condition, malfunction, or other
10. Lastly, you should be able to _flag_ a user as someone that has had issues in the past

Because you're an SQL _expert_ ü§ì, you decide to store all of this information in a database! 

‚ö†Ô∏è See [the "Write Some SQL" below](#write-some-sql) to get an idea of what queries you'd be running against this database. ‚ö†Ô∏è


### Create Data Models


1.  Based on the description above, create an ER Diagram to create a conceptual data model:
	* ‚úèÔ∏è use __google draw__ to do this: [https://docs.google.com/drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings)
		* share the drawing with other members in your group for collaborative editing
	* üî≤-‚ô¶Ô∏è-üî≤ with google draw, create a __chen__ style __ER diagram__ 
		* only entities and relationships required
		* name each entity and relationship (single name is adequate for relationships)
	* üêô there are __multiple ways to model the scenario described__, and there are clearly __ambiguities__ in the description
2. Create a physical data model based off of your conceptual model
	* üîß use __MySQL Workbench__ to do this
	* üîë you can use natural primary keys or surrogate / artificial keys 
	* üëÄ avoid data redundancy and update / insert/ delete anomalies by making sure your data model is in __3rd normal form__
	* üñº export this as a `.png`, and call the file `src/er-diagram.png`; do this by using File &rarr; export)
	* üóÑÔ∏è save your model by going to File &rarr; Save As  ... and using `src/scoot-share.mwb` as the file name
	* üíª lastly, use File &rarr; Export &rarr; Forward Engineer to generate sql
		* ‚ö†Ô∏è __make sure to check  "Omit schema qualifier in object names"
		* ...save the new file into `src/part-1-create-scooters.sql`
3. Write out the rationale for _some_ of your design decisions 	
	* üìñ write this in your `README.md`
	* ü§î it should describe _some_ of your design decisions (especially  ones that may be non-obvious or unexpected):
		* you could explain your choice of primary key(s), outline why your group chose a specific cardinality or why certain attributes were contained in one relation over another)
		* if there are tables that aren't in 3rd normal form, please point them out
		* describe why you did not normalize further ...or if there are any issues that would come up due to that design decision
		* lastly, __describe any assumptions__ you had to make _due to the ambiguities_ in the description above

### Create Tables, Insert Data, and Write Some Queries!

Use your generated
Try inserting some data into your tables. Save your inserts in: `src/part-1-insert-scooters.sql`

1. create a database on the server using [the database management tool](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/databases)
	* call the database `scootshare`
2. use the commandline client to issue the `CREATE` statements generated from mysql workbench
	* ‚ö†Ô∏è  __if mysql workbench generates  `VISIBLE`  as  part of the create statement, remove only `VISIBLE`
	* you can potentially use [phpmyadmin](https://cims.nyu.edu/phpMyAdmin) to do this (if it doesn't give you the 403 error)
		* once you've logged in, _use_ a database by clicking on the databases tab
2. insert two or more records into each table 
3. try to create example data that would reflect how _real_ data might look in the database
4. be mindful of foreign key constraints

Run some queries!

In `src/part-1-queries-scooters.sql`, write queries for the following. __It's ok if you're not able to fully run / test your queries based on what you've inserted previously__ ... just use this as a way to test your data model:

1. List all people (names are adequate) that have flags in any sort order
2. List all available scooters in any sort order
3. List all scooters (scooter model and manufacturer, along with person's name... and when they're due back) that are being borrowed in order of when they're due back ordered by when whey were due increasing (that is, earlier ones appear first, and more recent ones appear later)
4. List the top 5 people (names and number of referrals) that have the most referrals sorted by most referrals descending
5. Given a unique identifier for a person, show all of the dates that person has borrowed a scooter in chronological order (from the first time they borrowed a scooter to the most recent)
6. List all of the manufacturers of scooters in your database, __even if you don't currently have any of their scooters in your inventory__


## Part 2: Normalize the data from previous assignments....

1. Use the data that you've worked on in previous assignments or find a new data set:
	* copy over your documentation (source, license, etc.) into `README.md`
	* create a physical data model using MySQL workbench
		* save the file in `src/part-2.mwb`
		* export an image into `src/part-2-er-diagram.png` (or `jpg`)
	* create at least three tables with foreign key relationships based on this data
	* make sure that the resulting tables are minimally in 3rd normal form
	* use file &rarr; export &rarr; forward engineer
	* ...and save the new file into `src/part-2-create-normalization.sql`
2. Insert some data into the three tables
	* you can manually create insert statements to do this
	* save any sql you've written into a file called `src/part-2-insert-normalization.sql` 
3. Write the following queries and __describe what they do in a comment__... all within `src/part-2-queries-normalization.sql`:
	1. a query that involves an inner join
		* use a comment to describe the query
	2. a query that involves an outer join (left, right or full)
		* use a comment to describe the query
	3. a query that involves an inner join and an aggregate function
		* use a comment to describe the query
