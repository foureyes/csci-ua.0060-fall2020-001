# Homework #08 - MongoDB and PyMongo

__Overview__


1. Try out MongoDB
	1. Import csv data into MongoDB
	2. Run a few queries on the resulting dataset through MongoDB
2. Try out PyMongo


__Submissions__

* work in groups of 3 to 5
	* make sure that you all have mongodb configured on i6
	* the groups are uploaded in a pinned post on piazza
	* __each group only has to turn in one form__ (make sure the netids of all group members are included)
* ⚠️ submit by using the form at the end of the instructions

## Part 1: MongoDB Data Import, Queries

### Load Sample Data

1. Download [the latest `listings.csv.gz` data for __New York City__](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
	* Make sure the data that you're using is __New York City__ (there are several cities listed)
	* You can then upload the data to i6
2. The file is compressed; extract the data on i6 by using this command: `gunzip listings.csv.gz`
3. Use `mongoimport` to bring in the json data
	* use __your username__ as the database and `listings` as the collection name
	* `mongoimport  --headerline --type=csv --db=YOURUSERNAME  --collection=listings --host=class-mongodb.cims.nyu.edu --file=listings.csv --username=YOURUSERNAME --password=YOURPASSWORD`
	* this import will take a few minutes
	* you may seem some "quota exceeded" errors interspersed between progress status; this is ok
	* there should be ~30k records inserted

### Query Sample Data

Use the `mongo` commandline client to run the following queries... __save both the query and the first two lines of the result in a text file__:

1. show exactly two documents from the `listings` collection in any order
2. show exactly 10 documents in any order... but print in easier to read format and noting the host names for further use
3. choose two host names... and show all of the listings hosted by either of the two hosts (for example, "Kamilla" or "Sonder"... though these two names may not exist in the _latest_ data set)
	* only show the `name`, `price`, `neighbourhood`, and `host_name`
4. find all the unique `host_name` ([see the docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.distinct/))
5. find all of the places that have more than 2 `beds` in `city` Brooklyn, ordered by `review_scores_rating` descending
	* only show the `name`, `beds`, `city`, `review_scores_rating`, and `price`
	* if you run out of memory for this query, try filtering `review_scores_rating` that aren't empty (`$ne`)... and lastly, if there's still an issue, you can set beds to exactly 2
5. show the number of listings per host
6. in `city`, New York, find the average `review_scores_rating` per `neighbourhood`, and only show the ones above a 95... sorted in descending order of rating ([see the docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sort/))

## Part 2: pymongo (optional)


### Setup

Install the following libraries to connect to mongodb with Python 

```
# on i6
pip3 install pymongo
```

### pymongo

1. in a file called `test.py`...
2. write the following code (note that this differs from the slides, as mongodb on i6 requires authentication):
	```
import pymongo
client = pymongo.MongoClient("class-mongodb.cims.nyu.edu") 
client.YOURUSERNAME.authenticate("YOURUSERNAME", "YOURPASSWORD", mechanism="SCRAM-SHA-1")
db = client["YOURUSERNAME"]
db.collection_names() 
listings = db["listings"]
c = listings.find_one()  # (or find... and loop over cursor)
print(c)   
```
3. reproduce one of your earlier queries:
	* find all of the places that have more than 2 `beds` in `city` Brooklyn, ordered by `review_scores_rating` descending
	* only show the `name`, `beds`, `city`, `review_scores_rating`, and `price`
	* note that in pymongo, you'll have to quote all of your keys!

### dash

1. in a file called `app.py`, copy and paste this code:
	<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html
import plotly.graph_objects as go
app = dash.Dash(__name__)
app.layout = html.Div(children=[
    html.H1(children='Example'),
    dcc.Graph(
        id='example-graph',
        figure={
            'data': [go.Bar(x=['label1', 'label2', 'label3'], y=[5, 1, 7])],
            'layout': {
                'title': 'Bar Chart'
                }
            }
        )
    ])
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
</code></pre>
2. (this is kind of tricky!) ... use pymongo to show the top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods based on average price of listings with 2 bedrooms... in a bar chart
	* you'll likely have to use the following operators:
		* [$project](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/) to select or calculate fields
		* [$reduce](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/reduce/), [$split](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/split/), and [$concat](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/concat/) to remove commas by splitting and joining again with concat
		* [$substrBytes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/substrBytes/), [$strLenBytes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/strLenBytes/), and [$subtract](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/subtract/) to remove dollar sign
		* [$convert](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/convert/) to convert to a double
