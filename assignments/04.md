# Assignment #4A - Connecting to Remote Server and MariaDB 

# ⚠️ Due Tuesday, 10/13 at Noon __BEFORE CLASS__!

<span class="hl">Make sure to submit this MONDAY BEFORE CLASS!</span> (there won't be any grace period for this, as it's a very short homework and necessary for the workshop on Monday).

In this homework, you'll:

1. connect to a remote server, i6
2. connect to MariaDB from that remote server
3. upload files to a remote server
4. run basic queries using the mysql commandline client



## Connecting to Remote Server, i6

### Overview

Courant (CIMS) offers a range computing related services. Two of these services, a "home" directory and a "web" directory for CS, DS, and web minors, are accessed through a host (_server_) called i6.cims.nyu.edu.

Initially, we'll be using i6 as a departure point for connecting to MariaDB... so before we get to working with a database, we'll need to get on i6 first.

### Account Information 

You should have had an account activation emailed to you that contains your account information. Note, however, if you've had an i6 account from a previous class, you will not have received an email, but instead can use your existing credentials. This [flowchart](https://cims.nyu.edu/cms_content/i6-account-access-troubleshooting.pdf) helps guide you through what steps you should take for troubleshooting connections.

### Instructions 

To login to i6, use ssh (MacOS, Linux) or WinSCP (Windows 10). See the [documentation for details](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/connect) on connecting. TL;DR version:

1. On MacOS/Linux
	* open a terminal (MacOS &rarr; search Terminal.app)
	* type in: `ssh YOUR_USERNAME@i6.cims.nyu.edu`, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual cims/i6 username (typically netid)
	* you will be prompted for a password
	* type your cims/i6 password (it will not be displayed as you type it)
	* go to step 3
2. On Windows 10
	* [download putty - using the install (.msi) is ok](https://www.putty.org/) (note - putty is not required if you already have an ssh client that you use)
	* run the application:
	* in the host name field, type in: `i6.cims.nyu.edu`
	* click on `Open`
	* you may be prompted to accept a host key; click `Yes`
	* enter your cims/i6 username (typically netid)... and then your cims/i6 password
3. Run Commands, Document Work	
	* [check out a quick overview of common commands](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/resetpassword)
	* once you've successfully logged in, type `pwd` to show what directory you're in
	* type `ls` to show the files in your home folder
	* take a screenshot of your terminal ([see instructions for MacOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) or use [the snipping tool on windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027213/windows-10-open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot) so that the __prompt displaying your username__ and __both commands__ and __their results__ are visible
	* for example:
		```
[jjv222@i6 ~]$ pwd
/home/jjv222
[jjv222@i6 ~]$ ls
movies.sql  public_html  
```
	* rename your image to `i6`, but keep the original extension (`i6.png`, `i6.jpg`) and drop the resulting image into your project folder (__your repository's _root_ directory__)
	* [here's an example repository](https://github.com/nyu-csci-ua-0060-001-fall-2020/hw04-example
)
	* link to in your `README.md` by typing the following code in your `README.md`: 
		```
## Connecting to i6
![connecting to i6](./i6.png)
```
	* (remember to modify the extension of necessary)


### Troubleshooting

If you can't login and you used the credentials sent via email or you know you already have an account on i6, you can [attempt to reset your password](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/resetpassword)


## Connect to MariaDB

### Overview

Once you're on i6, you can connect to the central database server, `warehouse.cims.nyu.edu`. An instance of MariaDB is running on warehouse, and you can use the `mysql` commandline client on i6 to connect to it.

The mysql __commandline client__ allows you to connect to the database server to use databases and query for data. 

Before you connect to warehouse, you'll need to create a database from the online _Database Manager_. From this web application, you can create another set of credentials for yourself (an account for working with databases), as well as create databases!

Full details can be found [in the documentation](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/userservices/databases), but a more concise version is below.

### Instructions

1. Go to the [Database Manager](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/login/cims?origin=%2Fwebapps%2Fdatabases)
2. Login with the same credentials you used to login for i6
3. Set your database password by clicking on `Reset Database Password`
4. Copy and save the password that appears on the screen
5. Create a new database by clicking on `Add New Database`
6. If you are prompted for a name for your new database, use `test` (note that your username will be used as prefix for the full database name: `username_test`
7. Go to termina/putty and login to i6 as in the first part of the assignment
8. Once you're logged in, try to connect to the database server by using the mysql client; the command is:
9. `mysql -h warehouse.cims.nyu.edu -u YOUR_USERNAME -p`
	* the `-h` flag specifies the hostname of the dbms you're connecting to
	* the `-u` specifies what user to login as
	* the `-p` flag prompts you for a password
10. Use the password you were given from the database manager
11. Once logged in, show all of the databases: `SHOW DATABASES;`
12. Connect to the database you just created: `USE NAME_OF_DATABASE;`
13. List the tables: `SHOW TABLES;`
14. Take a screenshot of the previous three commands
15. Rename the screenshot to `db.png` (or jpg)... and copy to the root of your repository
16. Display the image in your `README.md` by adding the following code:
	```
## Connecting to MariaDB
![connecting to MariaDB](./db.png)
```

## Uploading Files to i6

Use scp on MacOS... or on Windows, [winscp](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php), to upload a file to i6.

1. Download [movies.sql](../sql/joins/movies.sql), a file containing sql statements to create two tables and populate both tables with movie and genre data
2. Upload the file to i6
	* in MacOS, open a terminal and `cd` into the directory that you downloaded `movies.sql` to
	* for example, if you downloaded to your Downloads folder, `cd ~/Downloads`
	* in terminal, type `scp movies.sql YOUR_USERNAME@i6.cims.nyu.edu:~`
		* `YOUR_USERNAME` should be your cims/i6 username (typically netid)
		* enter your cims/i6 password when prompted
		* the `~` part means upload the file to the home directory
	* in Windows, use WinSCP to upload the file to your home directory
		* you're presented with a graphical user interface
		* you can drag and drop or use the buttons to transfer files from your computer (local) to i6 (the server)
3. Login to i6
4. Run the sql in `movies.sql` by using the mysql client
5. Type this command in terminal when logged in to i6: `mysql -h warehouse.cims.nyu.edu -u YOUR_USERNAME -p YOUR_DATABASE_NAME < movies.sql`
6. Connect to MariaDB with the mysql client, connect to your database... and finally `SHOW TABLES`, and describe both tables (`DESCRIBE movie;` and `DESCRIBE genre;`)
7. Take a screenshot of the results of the previous 3 commands (`SHOW` and `DESCRIBE` twice)
8. Rename the screenshot to `upload-sql.png` (or jpg)... and copy to the root of your repository
9. Display the image in your `README.md` by adding the following code:
	```
##  Uploading Files, Running SQL
![showing two tables](./upload-sql.png)
```
	
## Running Queries

While still connected, run any query that puts together data from both tables (for instance, use a `CROSS JOIN` or an `INNER JOIN`)

Take a screenshot of your query's output, rename it to `query.png` (or jpg), and, lastly, copy it to the root of your repository.  Display the image in your `README.md` by adding the following code:

```
##  Running Queries
![a join](./query.png)
```

Finally, add, commit, and push your files! Preview the markdown by checking your `README.md` on github's website.
