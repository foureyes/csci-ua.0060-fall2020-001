------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 9.  Display 30 rows of products again, sorted by the name of the product in
--     alphabetical order. This time, however, show BOTH the NAME of the 
--     product and its DESCRIPTION. Products without an associated description

--     WRITE YOUR QUERY BELOW.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 10  This part has several questions to answer:
--     
--     a. What should the possible values of product_type be based on the
--        documentation (https://www.fda.gov/media/97035/download)? 
--     b. Which table is this field located in? 
--     c. Why do you think it's included in that table?
--     d. What are the actual unique values in the database (please include the
--        correct casing) for product_type? Write a query to determine this.
--     e. Finally, find the location of the patient_age field and list out the 
--        unique possible values for it as well
--    
--     ANSWER QUESTIONS a - e IN SQL COMMENTS BELOW. WRITE YOUR QUERIES FOR 
--     FOR QUESTIONS d and e BELOW.

-- 10. How afraid should you be of yogurt? üôÄ Show the report_id, product 
--     name and age of all reports that involved yogurt AS THE SUSPECT! 
--    
--     * again, find the rows where yogurt is suspected as the culprit for
--       the adverse reaction
--     * only include reports that have a patient's age in years
--     * sort the results by the patient's year age from oldest to youngest
--     * it's ok to hardcode strings that help your query filter:
--       * for a product name that's similar to yogurt 
--       * an age that's in years
--     * but don't hardcode any other values
--     * hint: there's probably a lot of joins involved in this one!
--     WRITE YOUR QUERY BELOW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 10. Are there any reports that include more than one product as a 
--     SUSPECT? üïµÔ∏è A yes or no answer is adequate, but write a single query 
--     support your answer. Hint: can you show both the report id and the 
--     number of products that are suspect that it's associated with? Taken a 
--     step further, only show the reports that have more than 1 suspect 
--     product.
--
--     WRITE YOUR ANSWER AND QUERY BELOW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 11. Let's try using subqueries! Use your query above as a foundation. Find
--     the average (AVG) number of products per report that has more than one
--     suspect product. üòë
--    
--     * put your previous query in parentheses so that it can be used as an
--       "inner" query
--     * add a name after the parentheses to alias it (for example, tmp) so
--       so that you can refer to it in your outer query
--     * in your inner query, if you did not do so in your previous answer,
--       make sure all items in the select list are easily accessible (that
--       is, give expressions in your select list an alias with as)
--     * prior to your subquery,  you can use a select statement, but with
--       your subquery following from
--
--     WRITE YOUR ANSWER AND QUERY OR QUERIES BELOW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 12. Find the name, product code, and symptom (term) of all of the products 
--     (no duplicates) that give you nightmares üò±
-- 
--     * again, it's ok to hardcode the part of your query that searches for
--       nightmares, but do not hardcode anything else, though
--     * only show the first 30 results
--     * sort by name, ascending
--     * hint: there's even more joins!
--     WRITE YOUR QUERY BELOW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 13. When were the most recently entered reports (use the date that the 
--     report was made rather than when the "event" happened)? üìÖ
-- 
--     This is actually two queries:
--
--     1. find the date of the most recently entered report(s) 
--     2. reuse that query as part of a subquery to display the report id, 
--        product name, and the date of the most recently entered event(s)
--        * do not hardcode a limit
--
--     WRITE YOUR QUERY BELOW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 14. What are the 3 most common symptoms ü§Æ
--     
--     * include the name of the symptom and the count
--     * sorted by the count from greatest to least
--
--     WRITE YOUR QUERY BELOW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 15. Find the event that had the most symptoms (there could be a tie) ü§í
-- 
--     * show the primary key for the report, the created date, event date, 
--       product, description, patient_age, sex, and all symptom terms, along 
--       with the count of symptoms
--     * do this for all non exempt products (EXEMPT 4)
--
--     WRITE YOUR QUERY BELOW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 16. Show a comma separated list of symptoms / terms for every report üìù
-- 
--     * the symptoms should look something like: DIZZINESS,RASH,FEVER
--     * use the aggregate function, group_concat, to do this:
--       https://mariadb.com/kb/en/group_concat/
--     * include the report_id and list out the results sorted by the 
--       report_id
--     * only show 5 results
--
--     WRITE YOUR QUERY BELOW
